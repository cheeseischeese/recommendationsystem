# recommendationsystem
A recommendation system for movies based on collabrative filtering system.

## What is this recommendation system for and what I will do in this project.
  In todays world, every customer is faced with multiple chocies in watching movies. Recommendation system is used to save customers` time when they are trying to make choices.
  This recommednation system could recommend customer movies which based on what he or she has read and the most popluarly movies.
  I will also research on how and why this system will recommend some movies to users. 
## Why I choose this project?
  Personally, I got interested in Collaborative filtering algorithm in Data mining lectures. So I need a typical project to pratise.
  In addotion, data exposion makes making choices more difficult. Instead of wasting time on various sites, I could just log in and voila! 10 recommended objects tailored to my taste.
## How should I develope this system?
 The system is based on Cf alogritm to caculate the user preferrence. Basically, I will separate the dataset to trainingset and testing set. Analyzation on the testing result is also considered. (covered by python.)
 I will also trying to figure out the reason why the recommended outcome and explain the protential reason.
 
  The system is based on the dataset provided by the GroupLens Research Project
at the University of Minnesota.
   This data set consists of:
	 * 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
	 * Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
         * Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)

--- Data Analysis ---
1) Identify or hypothesize which patterns you are looking for in the data.
- Example: The date of release? Or the topic?
1.1) Explore which visualization or analysis would fit (e.g., compute std deviation in some features).
